### Permission Tweaking Practice

This challenge will ask you to change the permissions of the `/challenge/pwn` file in specific ways a few times in a row. If you get the permissions wrong, the game will reset and you can try again. If you get the permissions right eight times in a row, the challenge will let you `chmod` `/flag` to make it readable for yourself :-) Launch `/challenge/run` to get started!

**flag:** `pwn.college{practice}`

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions

hacker@practice~permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod +r /flag
hacker@practice~permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{practice}
