### Program and absolute paths

This challenge again requires you to execute it by invoking its absolute path. You'll want to execute the `run` file that is in the `challenge` directory that is, in turn, in the `/` directory. If you invoke the challenge correctly, it will give you the flag.

--- 
**Flag:** `pwn.college{MXyaD9E5AMykE0MP-M0gzKTE4WO.QX1QTN0wyNwkzNyEzW}`

command used: `/challenge/run`

Used the knowledge of absolute file paths to pass the absolute file path of the `run` file to get the flag.
