### implicit relative paths, from /

Let's try it here! You'll need to run `/challenge/run` using a relative path while having a current working directory of `/`. For this level, I'll give you a hint. Your relative path starts with the letter `c`

**Flag:** `pwn.college{Yh2unQjuafW4HQOWRlEFE-fnaHE.QX5QTN0wyNwkzNyEzW}`

command used: 
`cd /`
`challenge/run`

Changed my directory to the root directory as per given in the challenge. 
By using common sense, I guessed my relative file path would be `challenge/run` .
