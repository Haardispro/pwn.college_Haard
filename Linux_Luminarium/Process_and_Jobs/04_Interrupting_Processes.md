### Interrupting Processes 

Try it here! `/challenge/run` will refuse to give you the flag until you interrupt it. Good luck!

**flag:** `pwn.college{wx6w0olqFairv8yQYVk4ZQ9yb5L.QXzQDO0wyNwkzNyEzW}`

Command used: `Ctrl-C`

On running the command `/challenge/run`, it didn't give me the flag, so I pressed `Ctrl + C` to get the flag.
