### Foregrounding Processes

Imagine that you have a backgrounded process, and you want to mess with it some more. What do you do? Well, you can foreground a backgrounded process with `fg` just like you foreground a suspended process! This level will walk you through that!

**flag:** `pwn.college{gFrcNgfkhZNWsqSzF0rokG-qY4a.QX4QDO0wyNwkzNyEzW}`

Command used: 
`/challenge/run`
`Ctrl-Z`
`bg`
`fg`
`Ctrl-Z`

According to the description, we can foreground backgrounded processes. I did that and got the flag.
