### Help for Builtins 

Some good information! In this challenge, we'll practice using `help` to look up help for builtins. This challenge's `challenge` command is a shell builtin, rather than a program. Like before, you need to lookup its help to figure out the secret value to pass to it!

flag: `pwn.college{oRnc-_f9HD5bRonQ65NYA9_foDB.QX0ETO0wyNwkzNyEzW}`

Commands used: 
`help challenge`
`challenge --secret oRnc-_f9`

Used the `help` command to look at the docs for the builtin program `challenge`. 
Passed in required arguments to get the flag.
