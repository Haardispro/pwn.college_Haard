### Redirecting errors 

Let's put this into practice! In this challenge, you will need to redirect the output of `/challenge/run`, like before, to `myflag`, and the "errors" (in our case, the instructions) to `instructions`. You'll notice that nothing will be printed to the terminal, because you have redirected everything! You can find the instructions/feedback in `instructions` and the flag in `myflag` when you successfully pull this off!

Command used: `/challenge/run > myflag 2> instructions`
`cat myflag`

flag: ` pwn.college{w-O3S3KGHoUlilCm5Po8m1L5I8W.QX3YTN0wyNwkzNyEzW}`
