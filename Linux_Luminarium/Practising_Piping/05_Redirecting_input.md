### Redirecting input

You can do interesting things with a lot of different programs using input redirection! In this level, we will practice using `/challenge/run`, which will require you to redirect the `PWN` file to it and have the `PWN` file contain the value `COLLEGE`! To write that value to the `PWN` file, recall the prior challenge on output redirection from `echo`!

Command used: `echo COLLEGE > PWN`
`/challenge/run < PWN`
