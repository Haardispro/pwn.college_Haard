### Matching with ? 

Now, practice this yourself! Starting from your home directory, change your directory to `/challenge`, but use the `?` character instead of `c` and `l` in the argument to `cd`! Once you're there, run `/challenge/run` for the flag!

**flag:** `pwn.college{kk8hXZtux4rx5OFnCwGJYgO1Bs_.QXyIDO0wyNwkzNyEzW}`

Command used: 
`cd /?ha??enge`
`/challenge/run`

`?` is used to match the characters according to the passed argument. According to the challenge, I had to use `?` instead of `c` , `l`, therefore I did just that. I ran `/challenge/run` after that to get the flag.
