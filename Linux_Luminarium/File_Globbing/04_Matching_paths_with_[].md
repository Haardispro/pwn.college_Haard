### Matching paths with []

Now it's your turn. Once more, we've placed a bunch of files in `/challenge/files`. Starting from your home directory, run `/challenge/run` with a single argument that bracket-globs into the absolute paths to the `file_b`, `file_a`, `file_s`, and `file_h` files!

Command used: 
`/challenge/run /challenge/files/file_[bash]`

flag: `pwn.college{Uy5McVz49ghlmx73DD_UaYHYahR.QX0IDO0wyNwkzNyEzW}`

Essentially, what I learnt is that we can pass in absolute file paths for globbing with square brackets as well.
