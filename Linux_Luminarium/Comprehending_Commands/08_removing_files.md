### removing files 

Let's practice. This challenge will create a `delete_me` file in your home directory! Delete it, then run `/challenge/check`, which will make sure you've deleted it and then give you the flag!

**Flag:** `pwn.college{silwOta-7CjrbXS_STyJjjVCjf2.QX2kDM1wyNwkzNyEzW}`

commands used: 
`rm delete_me`
`/challenge/check`

The challenge creates a file called `delete_me` in my home directory and my job is to delete it using the `rm` command, therefore I did the same. 
I checked if the file is removed or not using `/challenge/check` which also gave out the flag.
