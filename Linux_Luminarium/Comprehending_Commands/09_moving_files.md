### moving files 

This challenge wants you to move the `/flag` file into `/tmp/hack-the-planet` (do it)! When you're done, run `/challenge/check`, which will check things out and give the flag to you.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{Ah3uy_hB0dfRQAGsy-aJVp42i62.0VOxEzNxwyNwkzNyEzW}`

commands used: `mv /flag /tmp/hack-the-planet`

The challenge has asked me to move `/flag` to `/tmp/hack-the-planet`, I did just that using the `mv` command. 
Checked if the file is moved using the `/challenge/check` command which also gave out the flag. 

#### What I learnt: 

This is how the `mv` command works: 
- `mv <source> <destination>`

Moves the source to the destination, the source can either be a file or a folder, doesn't matter.
