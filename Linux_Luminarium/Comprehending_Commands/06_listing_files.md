### listing files 

In this challenge, we've named `/challenge/run` with some random name! List the files in `/challenge` to find it.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{YIhFRNQEAPrVx9aifKaYM8FA9JK.QX4IDO0wyNwkzNyEzW}`

commands used: 
`cd /challenge`
`ls`
`./26548-renamed-run-6558`

Considering `/challenge/run` was renamed, I had to go to the `/challenge` directory to look for the renamed file using the `cd` command as shown above. 
To actually view which file contained the run file, I used `ls` to view the contents of `/challenge`
I found out the renamed file and ran it using `./26548-renamed-run-6558`.
