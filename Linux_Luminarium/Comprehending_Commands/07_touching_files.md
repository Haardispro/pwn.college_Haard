### touching files

It's that simple! In this level, please create two files: `/tmp/pwn` and `/tmp/college`, and run `/challenge/run` to get your flag!


**Flag:** `pwn.college{I17M_ddJDAb82YaUSiBGn_pC-m2.QXwMDO0wyNwkzNyEzW}`

commands used: 
`touch /tmp/pwn`
`touch /tmp/college`
`/challenge/run`

The `touch` command creates a file in the given directory. The challenge asked me to create two files in the `/tmp` directory and then run `/challenge/run` to get the file. I implemented the same using the commands given above.
