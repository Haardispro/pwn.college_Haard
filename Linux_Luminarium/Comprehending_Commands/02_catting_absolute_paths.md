### catting absolute paths

In this directory, I will not copy it to your home directory, but I will make it readable. You can read it with `cat` at its absolute path: `/flag`.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{I8_7SEgYvrsVxyHX1Lsp2sraOKu.QX5ETO0wyNwkzNyEzW}`

command used: `cat /flag`

By using my knowledge of absolute file paths and knowing the functionality of the `cat` command, I used the above mentioned command to get the flag.
