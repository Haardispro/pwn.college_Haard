### making directories 

Now, go forth and create a `/tmp/pwn` directory and make a `college` file in it! Then run `/challenge/run`, which will check your solution and give you the flag!

**Flag:** `pwn.college{Q8rGOT0j74nwI49bHDy-IVTdwiY.QXxMDO0wyNwkzNyEzW}`

commands used: 
`mkdir /tmp/pwn`
`cd /tmp/pwn`
`touch college`
`/challenge/run`

According to the challenge,  I had to make a directory in the `/tmp` directory called `/pwn`. I did that using the `mkdir` command. I changed my present working directory to `cd /tmp/pwn`. 
As per the challenge, I proceeded by making a file called `college` in the directory using `touch`. 
In the end, I ran `/challenge/run` to obtain the flag.
