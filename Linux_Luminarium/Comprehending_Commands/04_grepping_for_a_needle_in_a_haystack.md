### grepping for a needle in a haystack 

In this challenge, I've put a hundred thousand lines of text into the `/challenge/data.txt` file. Grep it for the flag!


**Flag:** `pwn.college{0kAvKt6TfY6bJ2sdhUWZ6_WOM7v.QX3EDO0wyNwkzNyEzW}`

command used: `grep "pwn.college" /challenge/data.txt`

#### What I learnt from this: 

This is how the grep command works: 
- `grep <stuff to look for> <where to look for>`
