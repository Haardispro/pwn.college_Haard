### cat: not the pet, but the command! 

In this challenge, I will copy the flag to the `flag` file in your home directory (where your shell starts). Go read it with `cat`!

**Flag:** `pwn.college{I_LyBtYW1PtXE5W6kncfhAf2Qh7.QXxcTN0wyNwkzNyEzW}`

command used: `cat flag`

The `cat` command reads out whatever is present in a given file. Running `cat` with a file called `flag` gave out the required flag.
