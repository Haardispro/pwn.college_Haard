### Printing variables 

Now it's your turn. Have your shell print out the `FLAG` variable and solve this challenge!

**flag:** `pwn.college{IbZmvcG9ST0kYXrBV4PDZDMXy6s.QX3UTN0wyNwkzNyEzW}`

Command used: `echo $FLAG`

What I learnt from the full description of this challenge is that, you can print out variables using the `$` sign followed by the variable name. I did just that and got the flag.
