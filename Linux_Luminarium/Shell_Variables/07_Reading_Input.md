### Reading Input

In this challenge, your job is to use `read` to set the `PWN` variable to the value `COLLEGE`. Good luck!

**flag:** `pwn.college{0tGjUisYBQ0gOv_gQd0ycetVFFZ.QX4cTN0wyNwkzNyEzW}`

command used: 
`read PWN`
`INPUT: COLLEGE`

What I learnt is that you can read the value of a given variable and store it, just like `scanf` or `input()` in python in bash.

I did just that and got the flag.
