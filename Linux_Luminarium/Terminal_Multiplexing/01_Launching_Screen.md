### Launching Screen 

For this challenge, we've hooked things up so that just launching screen will get you the flag. Easy!

**flag:** `pwn.college{Mw-BTUqAHTcr6KQWyfHNNNGN76J.0VN4IDOxwyNwkzNyEzW}`

Command used: `screen`

#### What I learnt: 
`screen`Â is a program that creates virtual terminals inside your terminal. It's somewhat like having multiple browser tabs, but for your command line!
