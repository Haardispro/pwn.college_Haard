### Switching Windows 

For this challenge, we've set up a screen session with two windows:

- Window 0 has a welcome message
- Window 1 has... well, you'll have to switch there to find out!

Attach to the session withÂ `screen -r`, then use one of the key combinations above to switch to Window 1. Go get that flag!

**flag:** `pwn.college{obCuDd9u5MJUpqBCTnknQlprTmj.0FO4IDOxwyNwkzNyEzW}`

Command used: 

`screen -r`

`Ctrl A 0`

Got the flag after switching to window 0.
