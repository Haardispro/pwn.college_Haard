### Chaining with Semicolons

Give it a try now! In this level, you must run `/challenge/pwn` and then `/challenge/college`, chaining them with a semicolon.

**flag:** `pwn.college{oWTM4cWoYTs5G3qmB6h7AW0VRNb.QX1UDO0wyNwkzNyEzW}`

Commands used: 
`/challenge/pwn ; /challenge/college`

You can chain two commands together using `;`, that is what I did to get the flag.
