### Your First Shell Script 

Now, it's your turn! Same as last level, run `/challenge/pwn` and then `/challenge/college`, but this time in a shell script called `x.sh`, then run it with `bash`!

**flag:** `pwn.college{gO4oOARU3YVhsXU7t1MUKTSPDyC.QXxcDO0wyNwkzNyEzW}`

x.sh: 
```bash
/challenge/pwn ; /challenge/college 
```
Command used: 
`bash x.sh`

Created a file `x.sh`, whose contents are shown above and ran it using `bash` according to the instructions.
